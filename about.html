<p>The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with one large solar panel mounted on one side and a large cylinder on top (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) that acts as a mounting structure for the lander. In addition to the lander, the module carries a payload called Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) to study the spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1-1.7 Î¼m)

The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST[11] and lunar injection of 100 km circular polar orbit was completed successfully as part of phase one.[2][12] The lander and rover are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023.Rover:


Chandrayaan-3 Rover
Chandrayaan-3 Rover Overview:

Six-wheeled design
Weight of 26 kilograms (57 pounds)
Range of 500 metres (1,600 ft)
Scientific instruments including cameras, spectrometers, and a drill
Expected lifespan of one lunar day (14 Earth days)
Communication with the lander and ground control team in India
The rover has two payloads:

Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) will derive the chemical composition and infer mineralogical composition of the lunar surface.
Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) will determine the elemental composition (Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Fe) of lunar soil and rocks around the lunar landing site.
The Chandrayaan-3 Rover is expected to make a number of important scientific discoveries, including:

The composition of the lunar surface
