<dd>Climate change is said to have in part caused (but may also be a natural evolution of earth's cycle) large-scale floods across central <strong>India</strong>, including the Mumbai floods of 2006 and 2017. During 1901–2015, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events, across central and northern India – Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, <del>Odisha</del>, Jharkhand, Assam and parts of Western Ghats – Goa, north Karnataka and South Kerala.[16] The rising number of extreme rain events are attributed to an increase in the fluctuations of the monsoon westerly winds, due to increased warming in the <big>Arabian Sea</big>. This results in occasional surges of moisture transport from the Arabian Sea to the subcontinent, resulting in heavy rains lasting for <small>2–3 days</small>, and spread over a region large enough to cause floods</dd>
