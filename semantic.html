	<h2>Embedded Logic Design (ELD):</h2>
<p>This course will introduce students to the various programmable logic devices (PLDs) available in the market and get them started with how to program such devices to develop simple applications. First half of this course will be targeting MCU programming and the second half will cover FPGA programming and synthesis.</p>

<summary>Signals and Systems (S&S)</summary>
<p>This course is designed as a core course for second year of ECE students. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of continuous and discrete time signal representation, Linear Time Invariant Systems (LTI), Fourier series representation of periodic signals, continuous and discrete time Fourier transform, Laplace and Z-transforms and their application.</p>

<h2>Maths III (Multivariable Calculus, Complex Variables, Vector Calculus):</h2>
<p>The course is intended to cover topics in multivariable calculus, complex variables and vector calculus. The topics included are those required for concurrent or subsequent courses in signals and systems, electro-magnetic theory and mathematics which most of these students will have to take as core courses.</p>
<h2>Principles of Communication Systems (PCS)Circuit Theory and Devices:</h2>
<p>The course is intended to be a broad introduction to Communication Systems. The course will develop understanding of the principles underlying communication systems, describe basic methods for communication and develop requisite mathematical background required for noise analysis of communication systems. The lectures will be supplemented by PyLab simulation exercises.</p>
<h2>Integrated Electronics (IE):</h2>
<p>Analog electronic circuits and systems are present in diverse applications ranging from telecommunication to automobiles. It is therefore essential to understand the underlying theory and the techniques employed in the design of analog circuits and the associated components. This course starts with an overview of semiconductor technology. Subsequently it covers Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), Small Signal BJT models, BJT based amplifiers, Metal Oxide Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET), Small Signal MOS models, MOSFET based amplifiers, High Frequency BJT and MOS models, Cascode Amplifier, Common Mode and Differential Amplifiers, Bode Plot, Gain and Phase Margins, and Active Filters. The course also includes a lab component in which the students will be introduced to a circuit simulation and design tool and to the standard laboratory equipments.</p>

<h2>Fields and Waves (F&W)</h2>:
<p>This course is intended to be a broad introduction to Engineering Electromagnetics and its applications. The course will develop understanding of the principles underlying time-varying fields and Maxwellâ€™s equations, describe plane electromagnetic waves and develop its mathematical model for different media for its interaction with interfering planes. The second half of the course builds on the foundations covered in the first half and introduces the transmission line concepts.</p>
