<p>As part of the Chandrayaan programme to demonstrate soft landing on the Moon, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM 3) launch vehicle consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover.[15] The lander was scheduled to touchdown on the lunar surface in September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover.
<br/>  
The European Space Tracking (ESTRACK) operated by European Space Agency (ESA) will support the mission according to a contract.Under the new cross-support arrangement, ESA tracking support could be provided for upcoming ISRO missions such as those of India’s first human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan, the Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander and the Aditya-L1 solar research mission. In return, future ESA missions will receive similar support from ISRO’s own tracking stationsChandrayaan-3 Rover Overview:

Six-wheeled design
Weight of 26 kilograms (57 pounds)
Range of 500 metres (1,600 ft)
Scientific instruments including cameras, spectrometers, and a drill
Expected lifespan of one lunar day (14 Earth days)
Communication with the lander and ground control team in India
The rover has two payloads:

Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) will derive the chemical composition and infer mineralogical composition of the lunar surface.
Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) will determine the elemental composition (Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Fe) of lunar soil and rocks around the lunar landing site.
The Chandrayaan-3 Rover is expected to make a number of important scientific discoveries, including:

The composition of the lunar surface
The presence of water ice in the lunar soil
The history of lunar impacts
The evolution of the Moon’s atmosphere
